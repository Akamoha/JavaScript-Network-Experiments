# JavaScript-Network-Experiments
Basic skeleton code for experimenting with JavaScript network libraries:

1. Cytoscape.js (http://js.cytoscape.org/)
2. vis.js (http://visjs.org/)

The positions of nodes are randomly generated.

Also tried using a vector graphics library:

Raphael.js (http://raphaeljs.com/)

This code takes the input from a .txt file containing the coordinates of each node.
